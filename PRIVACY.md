# ðŸ”’ Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 2025*

Hi there! This is the privacy policy for InstaSearch. I'll keep it simple and straightforward.

## What I collect

**The short version:** Almost nothing.

InstaSearch doesn't require you to create an account or provide personal information. Here's what happens when you use the app:

- **Search queries** - When you search for images, that request goes directly to Unsplash's API. I don't store or track your searches.
- **Usage analytics** - I use basic web analytics to see how many people visit the site and which features are popular. This is anonymous data (no names, emails, or personal info).
- **Technical logs** - Like most websites, the server keeps basic logs for security and performance monitoring.

## What I don't collect

- No email addresses
- No personal information
- No user accounts (yet - when I add this feature, I'll update this policy)
- No tracking across other websites
- No selling data to anyone

## Cookies and storage

InstaSearch uses minimal browser storage:

- **Theme preference** - Whether you prefer dark or light mode (stored in your browser)
- **Analytics cookies** - Anonymous usage statistics to help improve the app

That's it. No tracking cookies, no advertising cookies, no weird stuff.

## Third-party services

InstaSearch uses these external services:

**Unsplash API** - All images come from Unsplash. When you search or download images, you're interacting with their service. Check out [Unsplash's Privacy Policy](https://unsplash.com/privacy) for details on how they handle data.

**Vercel (hosting)** - The app is hosted on Vercel, which means they handle the technical infrastructure. See [Vercel's Privacy Policy](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy) for their data handling practices.

## Your rights

Since I collect almost no personal data, there isn't much to manage. But if you have concerns:

- You can clear your browser data anytime to remove stored preferences
- Contact me at kethanvr@gmail.com if you have questions
- You can stop using the app anytime (though I hope you don't!)

## Changes to this policy

If I ever change how privacy works in InstaSearch, I'll update this page and let users know about important changes.

## Questions?

Privacy is important, and I want you to feel comfortable using InstaSearch. If you have any questions about how your data is handled, just email me at kethanvr@gmail.com.

*This policy reflects my commitment to keeping InstaSearch simple, transparent, and respectful of your privacy.*
