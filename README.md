## What's InstaSearch?

I built InstaSearch because I was tired of clunky stock photo sites. You know the feeling - you need a simple image for your project, but you end up clicking through endless menus and slow-loading pages.

InstaSearch cuts through all that noise. Just search, filter if you want, and download. That's it.

**Who might find this useful:**

- Designers who need good photos fast
- Developers building mockups or demos
- Content creators looking for backgrounds
- Students working on presentations
- Anyone who appreciates clean, simple tools

## What it does

**üîç Search** - Type what you're looking for, get relevant results from Unsplash's millions of photos

**üé® Filter** - Narrow down by orientation (landscape/portrait/square), colors, or how popular the image is

**üì± Works everywhere** - Built mobile-first, so it looks good on your phone, tablet, or computer

**üåô Dark mode** - Because your eyes matter, especially during late-night design sessions

**‚¨áÔ∏è Download options** - Get the size you need: small for web, large for print, or the full resolution

**ü§ñ AI Image Generation** - Create custom images from text prompts using Google's Gemini AI (NEW!)

**‚ö° Actually fast** - No loading spinners that make you question your internet connection

### Coming up

I'm working on some cool stuff for the future:

- **User accounts** - Save your favorite images
- **Collections** - Organize images into folders
- **Download history** - See what you've grabbed before
- **Better search** - Maybe some AI to understand what you really mean

No crazy timelines or promises, just building when I can.

## How to run it yourself

Want to tinker with the code or run it locally? Here's how:

```bash
# Grab the code
git clone https://github.com/Kethanvr/instasearch.git
cd instasearch

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Fire it up
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 and you're good to go.

**Need your own API keys?** Create a `.env.local` file and add:

```
# For Unsplash image search
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_key_here

# For AI image generation (NEW!)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

- Get a free Unsplash key from [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
- Get a free Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)

Both take just a couple of minutes to set up!

## What's under the hood

Built with stuff I actually enjoy working with:

- **Next.js 15** - Because it just works and the new features are solid
- **TypeScript** - Saves me from my own mistakes
- **Tailwind CSS** - Fast styling without the CSS headaches
- **Framer Motion** - Makes things move nicely
- **Unsplash API** - Where all the beautiful photos come from

No over-engineering, no trendy frameworks that'll be dead next year. Just solid, reliable tools that get the job done.

## Found a bug? Got ideas?

I'm always open to feedback. If something's broken or you think of a cool feature:

- **Bug reports**: Just open an issue on GitHub with what went wrong
- **Feature ideas**: Tell me what would make this more useful for you
- **Code contributions**: Fork it, make it better, send a PR

Or just email me at kethanvr@gmail.com if GitHub feels too formal.
