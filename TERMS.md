# ðŸ“œ Terms of Service

*Last updated: January 2025*

Welcome to InstaSearch! These terms are pretty straightforward, but I need to cover the legal basics.

## The deal

InstaSearch is free to use. I built it as a simple way to search and download images from Unsplash. You can use it for personal projects, commercial work, whatever you need.

## What you can do

- Search for images
- Download images for any purpose
- Use the app on any device
- Share the app with others

## What you can't do

- Try to break or hack the app
- Use it for anything illegal
- Claim you built it
- Overwhelm the servers with automated requests

## About the images

**Important:** All images come from Unsplash, not me. Each image has its own license terms:

- Most Unsplash images are free to use for any purpose
- Some may require attribution to the photographer
- Always check the specific license for images you download
- I'm not responsible for how you use the images

InstaSearch just helps you find and download them - the actual licensing is between you and Unsplash.

## Disclaimers

I built InstaSearch in my spare time and do my best to keep it working well, but:

- The app is provided "as is" without warranties
- I can't guarantee it'll work perfectly 100% of the time
- Unsplash's API might have outages (not my fault!)
- I'm not liable for any issues that arise from using the app

## Service availability

I plan to keep InstaSearch running, but I reserve the right to:

- Make updates and improvements
- Temporarily take it offline for maintenance
- Discontinue the service (with advance notice)

## Changes to these terms

If I need to update these terms, I'll post the changes here and update the date at the top.

## Feedback and disputes

Got a problem or suggestion? Email me at kethanvr@gmail.com and I'll do my best to help.

For legal disputes (hopefully never needed), these terms are governed by Indian law.
